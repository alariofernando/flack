# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


I learned to use flask-WTF for protecting me against CSRF attacks, and how to use flask Macros to minimize boilerplate code!


Project is now finished, just to add a personal touch and maybe some more styling!

I intentionally not used jQuery, Ajax and Handlebars for this project.
